Increase vm.min_free_kbytes value, for example to a higher value than a single allocation request.
Change vm.zone_reclaim_mode to 1 if it's set to zero, so the system can reclaim back memory from cached memory.

sysctl -a | grep vm.min_free_kbytes
vm.min_free_kbytes = 90112

sysctl -a | grep vm.zone_reclaim_mode

To set a persistent value for a sysctl parameter in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and RHEL 8 which will be applied at boot:

Create a new conf file under the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory. File names take the format /etc/sysctl.d/<name>.conf. Files in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory are parsed in order so it is recommended to prepend the file name with a number signifying the order you would like the files to be parsed in. For example, /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf:

Raw
# cat /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
vm.zone_reclaim_mode=1
vm.min_free_kbytes=900000

To have the system immediately apply the values in a new/updated /etc/sysctl.d file, run sysctl -p <filename>:

Raw
# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
The sysctl values are loaded early in boot via initramfs, so finally, rebuild initramfs to 
override any previous persistent sysctl settings in the initial ramdisk image.

Raw
# dracut -f -v
